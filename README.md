# Introduction

# Methods

## Empirical networks

Empirical networks were constructed from the interactions recorded by
@Kopelke2017FooStr. This dataset consists of replicate samples of *Salix*
(willow species) -- willow-galling sawfly -- predator interactions across
Europe. Data collection spanned 29 years across 641 sites (some with repeat
visits) revealing 1 173 links across sites and trophic levels. Sites spanned a
large latitudinal (in the context of continental Europe) from Italy (39.00$/deg$
N) to Norway (70.78$/deg$ N). Making this a good dataset to interrogate
regarding the aim of this paper owing to the large environmental gradient.
